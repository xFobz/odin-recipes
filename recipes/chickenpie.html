            <h3>Make the filling</h3>
            <li>Boil the cubed chicken with the carrots, peas, 
                and celery for about 15 minutes. Drain and set 
                aside. Cook the onions in butter until they're 
                translucent, then stir in the flour and seasonings. 
                Add the chicken broth and milk and simmer until 
                the filling is thick. </li>
            <h3>Fill and Bake the Pie</h3>
            <li>Place the chicken-vegetable mixture in an unbaked pie
                 crust. Pour the chicken broth mixture over it. Cover
                  with the top crust, seal the edges, and cut slits
                   in the top to allow the steam to escape. Bake until
                    the pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.
