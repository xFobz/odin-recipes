    <h2>What are crepes?</h2>
    <p>A crêpe or crepe is a very thin type of pancake. 
        Crêpes originated in Brittany, a region in western France, during the 13th century, 
        and are now consumed around the world.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
